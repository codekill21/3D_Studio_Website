### *** Remarks and appreciation ***

This project was designed from a reference design created by a dribbble user: https://dribbble.com/shots/22476356-Izanami-Studio-3D-Design-Studio-Landing-Page, I just developed the idea using NextJS and Typescript. This is a personal project and a way to keep on practising and improve my programming skills.
